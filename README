Foose is a project to bring functional programming niceties to Perl

AIMS

We aim to produce these functional niceties on two levels, one a perl library and secondly some Devel::Declare-ish magic to provide pleasing syntax.

PERL AIMS
* Lightweight declaration of Algebraic Data Types
* Compile-time type checking in as far as is possible (matching up the user-defined types, I suspect)
* Lazy lists library for Perl
* Proper, functional map and grep replacements
* Monad library with continuations support
* Currying and composition support
* More haskell-ish and lisp-ish functions that fit in with the above (in the vein of Language::Functional)
* Some way of developing a synergy between Moose and functional programming.

SUGAR LAYER AIMS
* Pleasing syntax for all of the above
* Interoperability with Moose
* Synergy between Moose and Foose

Currently, the first of the Perl aims is in progress, with C<Foose::ADT>

The sample code is being written with Moose, and some of the lessons learnt from
this will hopefully be useful in testing the design and assumptions of Foose!
